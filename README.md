- 👋 Hi, I’m @gipsyjaeger, but call me Ethan
- 👀 I’m interested in building up my skills in development and starting work on some projects, both in and outside of uni!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that'll look interesting on my portfolio, and maybe some games too :P 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Here?!
