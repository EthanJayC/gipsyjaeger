- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ethan, I'm currently in my final year to get my BEng in Software Engineering, and am currently working as a .NET developer for a well-established UK company.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building my own projects based on personal interests, that can be scaled across platforms and help people in life.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing heavily in asp.net, especially within Unity for both 3D and VR environments!
